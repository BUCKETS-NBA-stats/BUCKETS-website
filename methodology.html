									<!--Intro-->
									<p>BUCKETS<sup><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="BUCKETS stands for Baseline adjUsted Categorized KrEation poinTS. We couldn't resist the sabermetric tradition of giving dubious acronyms to new advanced stats.">[1]</span></sup>
										 is a new set of NBA stats that accounts for every point created, every possession used to create them, and the context in which those things happen. It consists of:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>PRF (Points Responsible For):</b> Points scored + assisted, including both field goals and free throws. This measures offensive <b>production</b></li>
										<li><b>Plays:</b> Total possessions the player used while attempting to score or set up a teammate, including field goal attempts, free throw attempts, and turnovers. This measures offensive <b>volume</b> or usage</li>
										<li><b>PC (Points Created):</b> PRF - baseline value for the play types used. This measures total offensive <b>value</b> added over the baseline</li>
										<li><b>rORTG (relative offensive rating)</b> PC per 100 Plays. This measures offensive <b>efficiency</b></li>
									</ul>
									<p style="margin: 0;">These stats are broken down into <u>3 offensive roles</u>:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>On-ball:</b> Creating with the ball in your hands, such as by running a pick and roll, isolating, or posting up</li>
										<li><b>Off-ball:</b> Getting set up to score without the ball. This is subdivided into <u>Partner</u> (receiving a handoff or setting a pick and roll screen and rolling or popping), <u>Space</u> (getting the ball coming off a screen or spotting up), and <u>Crash</u> (cutting to the basket or trying for a putback)</li>
										<li><b>Transition:</b> Pushing the ball or running the floor before the defense is set</li>
									</ul>
									<p>BUCKETS stats are available as far back as the 2005-06 season, when tracking data first became reliable and widespread.</p>
									<p>The rest of this article explains <a href="#Motivation">why we need new stats</a>, <a href="#Uses">what they are useful for</a>, <a href ="#Methodology">how they are calculated</a>, and <a href="#Limitations">what the limitations are</a>.</p>

									<!--Why new stats-->
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2 id="Motivation">Why we need new stats</h2>

									<p>Together, the BUCKETS stats do several useful things that traditional box scores and existing advanced stats don't:</p>

									<h4>Count every point created</h4>
									<p>Scoring and playmaking are two sides of the same coin. The best offensive players use the threat of their scoring to set up opportunities for their teammates, and use the threat of their playmaking to open up scoring chances for themselves.</p>
									<p>Existing stats like points per game, assists, and true shooting only look at one side of this coin or the other. But points scored and points created for teammates both count the same on the scoreboard. BUCKETS considers them all together.</p>
									
									<h4>Count every possession used</h4>
									<p>In the process of trying to score or create for teammates, players might attempt a field goal or generate a free throw, they might pass the ball to a teammate who themselves attempts a field goal or generates a free throw, or they might turn the ball over while trying to do any of those things.</p>
									<p>Almost all usage and efficiency stats (like usage % and true shooting) only account for some of these events<sup><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Seth Partnow's Total Usage is an exception">[2]</span></sup>. But all of these events are ways that possessions are used in the pursuit of creating points. BUCKETS counts them all.</p>

									<h4>Account for context and role</h4>
									<p>All points count equally, but not all points are created equally. Someone needs to face down a set defense and try to create an advantage with the ball. Other players support this by spacing the floor, setting screens, fighting for position, and moving off-ball. To understand how valuable a player's offense is, we need to understand the role he is playing.</p>
									<p>Existing stats have no way to account for this &mdash; they can't distinguish a player creating points against a set half court defense from a player finishing easy shots created by others. BUCKETS understands and accounts for this context.</p>

									<!--What they are useful for-->
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2 id="Uses">What these stats are useful for</h2>

									<p>Here are some examples of what you can do with these stats:</p>
									
									<h4>Understand players' roles and effectiveness</h4>
									<p>Our stats provide a useful snapshot into a player's game, the roles he plays, and how effective he is in those roles.</p>

									<!--Update this when we have historicals updated-->
									<p><a href="player career.html?player=Dwight Howard">Dwight Howard</a> provides a great case study. At his peak, he averaged more than 20 points per game on over 60% true shooting. Superficially, those sound like the numbers of a player you want as your #1 or #2 option on offense. But on <a href="player career.html?player=Dwight Howard">Howard's career profile</a>, we can see that he doesn't fit this mold.</p>
									<p>Most of Howard's total <i>production</i> came On-ball, which in his case meant post-ups. But this is not where he produced his value. In his prime, his efficiency on these was mediocre, and then he still kept trying them as he aged and his efficiency fell further and further.</p>
									<!--Insert screenshot-->
									<p>Instead, Howard was more valuable, and if anything underutilized, as a complementary offensive player. He produced a majority of his <i>value</i> on 'Off-ball: Crash' plays, where he was insanely effective attacking the rim off ball and getting putbacks. And interestingly, he also produced quite a bit of value as an Off-ball: Partner despite having relatively modest production there, indicating just how efficient he was as a roll man when he was used that way.</p>  
									<p>You can explore more players on our <a href="player.html">player overview</a> page.</p>

									<h4>Analyze how team offenses fit together</h4>
									<!--Update this when we have historicals updated-->
									<p>Looking across all the players on a team provides a picture of who fills what roles on offense, and how well the pieces synergize or don't. Take the <a href="team summary.html?team=Houston Rockets 2016-17">2016-17 Houston Rockets</a> as an example.</p>
									<!--Insert screenshot-->
									<p>
										 You can see how much they were built around James Harden, as he shouldered the lions share of on-ball possessions, with MVP-level effectiveness.
										 He was flanked by dependent players. Some were plus floor spacers who could create a bit off of Harden's gravity (like Eric Gordon, Lou Williams, and Patrick Beverly).
										 Others were Harden's rollers and lob threats (like Clint Capela).</p> 
									<p>You can explore more yourself on our <a href="team.html"><a>teams page</a>.</p>

									<h4>Contextualize where players stand relative to the league</h4>
									<p>Our <a href="league.html">League summary</a> for the 2024-25 season shows that Nikola Jokic has been the most valuable overall offensive creator in the leauge, while Shai-Gilgeous Alexander leads the association in on-ball value.</p>
									
									<h4>Get perspectives on player valuations and all-time rankings</h4>
									<p>These stats aren't the end-all, be-all of evaluating offense. But if you look at the <a href="all time peaks.html">players with the highest regular season peaks in points created</a>, you'll see a who's who of the best offensive players of the last two decades: Lebron, Curry, Nash, CP3, Durant, Harden, and Jokic.</p>

									<h4>Do deeper research</h4>
									<p>Pages like our <a href="custom league table.html">Searchable leaderboards</a> and <a href="bubble chart.html">Custom chart builder provide more ways of looking at the data that can lead to further insights.</a></p>
									<p>For example, these stats give the clearest picture available of a player's value as an on-ball creator. We can use that to <a href="floor raising.html">quantify the value of "floor-raising"</a>.</p>

									<!-- Detailed Methodology -->
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2 id="Methodology">How BUCKETS stats are calculated</h2>
									<p style="margin: 0;">At its core, the BUCKETS methodology is simple:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Add up all the points a player generates by scoring and directly creating for teammates (including free throws). To avoid crediting or punishing a player for their teammates' shooting, we use <a href="https://www.bball-index.com/glossary/">BBall Index's</a> Passing Creation Quality to estimate the expected points from playmaking</li>
										<li>Add up all the plays it takes to generate those points, noting which kinds of plays they are (ISO, Spot-Up, Transition, etc.)</li>
										<li>Compare the points generated to a baseline expectation - what a typical player "should" have generated on that portfolio of plays</li>
									</ul>

									<p>When we set that baseline, <strong>Roles matter</strong>. To evaluate a player on offense, we need to understand what roles they are playing, what it means to be successful in each of those roles, and how effective they are relative to that standards. As a result, the baselines for <a href="#On-ball">On-ball</a>, <a href="#Off-ball">Off-ball</a>, and <a href="#Transition">Transition</a> look different from each other.</p>

									<!--On ball-->
										<h3 id="On-ball">On-ball</h3>
										<p>This role is about breaking down a set defense to create an advantage. In the modern NBA, this is most commonly done as a pick and roll ball handler, but it can also be done through isolations, post ups, and running offense from the elbows. When we talk about whether a player is a “superstar” or "#1 option", we usually mean their skill in this role.</p>
										
										<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Principles behind our approach:</b></p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Scoring and playmaking blend</u>: Great offensive players use the threat of their scoring to open up the pass and the threat of their passing to open up their scoring. To understand their effectiveness, you have to look at both of those pieces together.</li>
											<li><u>Someone has to do it...</u>: A possession where no one creates an advantage usually results in a turnover, contested heave, or shot clock violation. To avoid those bad outcomes, someone needs to create an advantage. Many players can do this against a scrambled defense, but few can do it play after play when the opponent is expecting them. Being able to absorb that creation at high volume is hugely valuable.</li>
											<li><u>...but there's only one ball</u>: When one player is actively creating with the ball in their hands, that has an opportunity cost: their teammates can't be creating with the ball at the same time. On good teams with multiple skilled on-ball creators, this create diminishing returns. There are ways to mitigate this with careful schemes and rotations, but generally these teams will have a hard time using all of their on-ball creators to their full potential.</li>
										</ul>
									
										<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Actions included:</b></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Scoring and playmaking plays categorized by Synergy as Pick and roll ball handler possessions, Isolations, Post-Ups, and a handful of "Miscellaneous" plays.</li>
											<li>We also include what we call “Connective Passing” plays not categorized by Synergy. These are other half court playmaking opportunities, primarily hitting teammates off screens, handoffs, and cuts. We estimate these for each player based on their overall potential assists, bad pass turnovers, number of on-ball scoring plays, and the percentage of their scoring plays that occur in the half court.</li>
										</ul>	
										<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Efficiency baseline:</b></p>	
										<ul>
											<li><u>League-average half court offensive rating</u> is the starting point. </li>
											<li>We then adjust for <u>turnover frequency</u>. A missed field goal can turn into a second chance opportunity, but a turnover cannot. Therefore, a player who turns it over less frequenlty than average is contributing to his team by allowing more opportunities for offensive rebounds, while a player who turns it over more frequently is depriving his team of these chances<sup><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="He is also hurting his team's defense by allowing the opponents to get out in transition more, but since BUCKETS is an offensive stat it does not account for that effect">[3]</span>. </li>
											<li>We then further adjust for the impact of <u>floor raising</u>. Every team needs on-ball possessions, but not all players are effective at this role. Players that can absorb more on-ball volume than average, even at mediocre efficiency, benefit their team by displacing worse on-ball options. Conversely, those who have below average on-ball volume hurt their teams by forcing others to absorb more on-ball possessions. Therefore, we give a boost (or penalty) to players based on the expected value of worse possessions they displace (or don't). For more on this, see <a href="floor raising.html">our article on what we call the Westbrook Theorem</a> </li>
										</ul>
									
									<!--Off ball-->
										<h3 id="Off-ball">Off-ball</h3>
			
										<p>This role is about all the ways a player can generate points in the half court without being the one running the play. It includes spotting up, running off screens, rolling or popping after a pick, receiving handoffs, cutting, and trying for putbacks. While one player is creating on-ball, the other 4 players are doing some combination of these. When we talk about a player being a good "role player" on offense, we usually are referring to their skills in these roles.</p>
									
										<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Principles behind our approach:</b></p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Court geometry matters</u>: Different off-ball actions function differently in the geometry of a possession. Some involve coming to the ball, some involve spacing the floor, and some involve crashing to the rim. These interact with each other in varying ways, so it is useful to think about them separately.
											<li><u>Opportunities are dependent</u>: Players attacking off-ball need to get the ball before they can capitalize. When are they more likely to get the ball? When their teammates think they are open. This means off-ball shots that are attempted are disproportionately likely to be open. If the shot isn't open, the off-ball player will likely just move the ball along without shooting, or never receive it in the first place. We need to account for this selection effect when looking at the efficiency of these shots.</li>
										</ul>
									
										<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Actions included:</b></p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Partner</u>: Directly playing off the on-ball player by receving handoffs or rolling or popping out of a PNR screen</li>
											<li><u>Space</u>: Spotting up, running off a screen as a shooter</li>
											<li><u>Crash</u>: Cutting to the rim, playing out of the dunker's spot, attempting putbacks </li>
										</ul>
										
										<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Efficiency baseline:</b></p>
										<ul>
											<li>League-average offensive rating for that play type <u>or</u> league average half court offensive rating, whichever is higher.</li>
											<li>Comparing to average efficiency for that play type allows us to account for the fact that some off-ball attempts are naturally efficient almost regardless of who takes them. For example, by the time a player has gotten the ball on a cut to the rim and is attempting a shot, we expect them to score most of the time. </li>
											<li>As with on-ball, we also adjust for <u>turnover frequency</u></li>
										</ul>

									<!-- Transition-->
										<h3 id="Transition">Transition</h3>

										<p>The above on-ball and off-ball stats are both concerned about the half court when teams are playing 5-on-5. But the early seconds of a possession before both teams are back and set are an important source of offense. </p>
									
										<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Principles behind our approach:</b></p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Scoring and playmaking blend</u>: Even more than in the half-court, the line between scoring and playmaking in transition is blurred. Great transition players put defenders in a bind. They use their scoring threat to force the defender to commit and open up a teammate for an easy shot, and at the same time they use the threat of that pass to open up attack lanes for themselves.</li>
											<li><u>More transition opportunities are better</u>: Mediocre transition efficiency is great offense. In 2024, the least efficient transition offense (Denver) averaged 119.6 points per 100 in transition. The same season, the most efficient half court offense (Boston) averaged 106.5 points per 100. In other words, the "worst" transition offense was still 13 points per 100 better than the best half court offense. Players that can generate more transition possessions and keep their team out of the half court have a major impact on their team's offensive success.</li>
										</ul>
									
										<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Actions included:</b></p>
										<ul>
											<li>We use Synergy's definition of transition plays, with the addition of estimated potential assists and potential FT assists not captured by Synergy tracking.</li>
											<li> We estimate these for each player based on their overall potential assists, bad pass turnovers, number of transition scoring plays, and the percentage of their scoring plays that occur in transition.</li>
										</ul>
				
										<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Efficiency baseline:</b></p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Up to</u> the league average transition frequency (in 2024-25, this was 6.4 per 100 possessions played), the baseline for transition plays is <u>league average <b>transition</b> offensive rating</u>. These are transition plays a player "should" get, so they get credited or penalized for being more or less efficient than average on them.</li> 
											<li>For transition possessions <u>above</u> the league average transition frequency, the baseline is <u>league average <b>half court</b> offensive rating</u>. This credits players who generate more transition plays than expected and thereby displace what would have been half court possessions.</li>
										</ul>

									<!--Limitations-->	
										<hr class="major" />
										<h2 id="Limitations">Limitations</h2>
		
										<p>We believe that the stats introduced here are the best numbers to look at first to understand how a player performs on offense. However, they are not perfect.</p>
									
										<p>To belabor the obvious, these are offense only stats. They do not account at all for rebounding or defenese and Points Created is not intended as an "all in one" like RAPM or its many relatives.</p>
										<p>Our stats don't account for team and opponent context. We don't adjust for the quality of the opposing defense a player faces, nor do we adjust for a team's own roster, rotations, and scheme. We are only reporting the actual stats as they happened.</p>
										<p>Our stats also don't see anything outside of actions that end with a possession with a scoring attempt, playmaking attempt, or turnover. For example our stats don't measure the ways that players indirectly warp the defense through gravity and hockey assists. That said, we believe that these indirect impacts are correlated with the direct impact that we do measure. The players who rank highest in our Off-ball Spacing metrics will have the most gravity, and the best on-ball creators will also generate the most hockey assists.</p>
										<p>However, there are other elements of offense that our stats don't measure, even indirectly. For example, our stats can't see "record scratches" that fizzle out an action and allow the defense to reset. They also don't measure how players impact offense beyond scoring and playmaking, through things like setting screens, boxing out, or calling out plays.</p>
										<p>Finally, like with any stats, BUCKETS is a complement to watching games, not a substitute. They are useful as a way to identify interesting patterns to dig into with film (e.g., "Dwight Howard seemed to be an efficient roll man, yet he wasn't used that way very much &mdash; why was that?"). They are also a helpful way to quantify something that you noticed while watching (e.g., "Dwight's post ups looked really awkward and disjointed, how effective were they?"). If all you do is look at these stats in isolation, you will miss the deeper insights.</p>
