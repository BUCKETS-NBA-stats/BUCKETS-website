									<!--Intro-->
										<p>Current NBA stats ignore an important truth about offense, which muddles our understanding of the game. We are introducing some new stats to fix this problem.</p>
										<p>That important truth: <strong>Roles matter</strong>. When a team tries to score, the 5 players each take on different jobs. Someone needs to face down a set defense and try to create an advantage with the ball. Other players support this by spacing the floor, setting screens, fighting for position, and moving off ball. These aren't rigid jobs. Players will fill multiple roles over the course of a single possession or game. However, each role requires different skill sets and players tend to specialize in certain roles.</p>
										<p>Therefore, to understand how effective a player is on offense, we need to understand:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>What <u>roles</u> are they playing in the offense, how often?</li>
											<li>What does it mean to be <u>successful</u> in each of those roles?</li>
											<li>How <u>effective</u> is the player in that role, relative to that standard?</li>
										</ul>

										<p>BUCKETS is a new set of stats designed to answer those questions. These stats allow us to analyze how players perform in several major offensive roles (<u>creating on-ball</u>, <u>scoring off-ball</u>, and <u>running the floor in transition</u>), while accounting for the unique nuances and dynamics of each.</p>

										<p>For each of these roles, there are stats for:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>PRF (Points Responsible For):</b> the number of points the player produces in this role through scoring or direct playmaking</li>
											<li><b>Plays:</b> How many plays it takes for the player to produce those points, accounting for shot attempts, free throw attempts, and turnovers by themselves or the teammate they set up</li>
											<li><b>rORTG (relative offensive rating)</b> How efficiently the player created those points, compared to the baseline for this role</li>
											<li><b>PC (Points Created):</b> How the player would impact an average offense given their volume and efficiency in this role</li></ul>
										<p>These are used in combination to understand a player's effectiveness in their role, similar to how you would use stats like points, assists, true shooting, and usage. For example, here are Luka Doncic's BUCKETS stats for the 2022-23 season:</p>

									<!--Intro continued-->

										<p>The first row of this table tells us that in on-ball actions, Luka generated 43.9 points per game on his scoring and playmaking. He did this in 39.7 plays per game, with an effective offensive rating that was 10.3 points higher than the baseline. That combination of volume and efficiency in his on-ball role would add 4.09 points per game to the quality of an average offense.</p>

									<!--On ball-->
										<hr class="major" />
	
										<h2 id="On-ball">On-ball</h2>
										<p>This role is about breaking down a set defense to create an advantage. In the modern NBA, this is most commonly done as a pick and roll ball handler, but it also includes isolations, post ups, and running offense from the elbows. When we talk about whether a player is a “superstar”, we usually mean their skill in this role.</p>
										<p>To analyze on-ball creation, we need to keep a few things in mind:</p>
									
										<ul>
											<li><u>Scoring and playmaking blend</u>: Great offensive players use the threat of their scoring to open up the pass and the threat of their passing to open up their scoring. To understand their effectiveness, you have to look at both of those pieces together.</li>
											<li><u>Someone has to do it</u>: A possession where no one creates an advantage usually results in a turnover, contested heave, or shot clock violation. To avoid those bad outcomes, someone needs to create an advantage. Many players can do this against a scrambled defense, but few can do it play after play when the opponent is in position. Being able to absorb that creation at high volume is hugely valuable.</li>
											<li><u>Only one ball</u>: When one player is actively creating with the ball in their hands, that has an opportunity cost: their teammates can't be creating with the ball at the same time. On good teams with multiple skilled on-ball creators, this create diminishing returns. There are ways to mitigate this with careful schemes and rotations, but generally these teams will have a hard time using all of their on-ball creators to their full potential.</li>
										</ul>
									
										<p>What does this mean for our stats?</p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Actions included:</b> Plays categorized by Synergy as Pick and roll ball handler possessions, Isolations, Post-Ups, and a handful of "Miscellaneous" plays. We also include “Connective Passing” plays not categorized by Synergy. These are other half court playmaking opportunities, primarily hitting teammates off screens, handoffs, and cuts.</li>
											<li><b>Possessions counted:</b> All possessions that end with an on-ball scoring attempt, playmaking attempt, or turnover. This includes field goal attempts, free throw attempts, and turnovers by the player themself, and also FGAs, FTs, and TOs by a teammate they had just passed to.
												<ul style="margin: 0;"><li>Typically we look at volume per game or per 75 possessions. For on-ball plays, because there is only one ball, it can also be helpful to look at the share of the team's on-ball possessions the player uses while one the court. This is on-ball usage %, and it reflects how ball dominant the player's role is within their team's offense</li></ul></li>
											<li><b>Efficiency baseline:</b> League-average half court offensive rating. This provides a team-agnostic definition of the "opportunity cost" of only one player being able to create on-ball at a time. The true opportunity cost will vary depending on the quality of the player's teammates. For more on this, see <span style="color: red;">THIS ARTICLE ON FLOOR RAISING</span> </li>
										</ul>
									
									<!--Off ball-->
										<hr class="major" />
										<h2 id="Off-ball">Off-ball</h2>
			
										<p>This role is about all the ways a player can generate points in the half court without being the one running the play. It includes spotting up, running off screens, rolling or popping after a pick, receiving handoffs, cutting, and trying for putbacks. While one player is creating on-ball, the other 4 players are doing some combination of these. When we talk about a player being a good offensive role player, we usually are referring to their skills in these roles.</p>
									
										<p>To analyze off-ball roles, we need to keep a few things in mind:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Court geometry matters</u>: Different off-ball actions function differently in the geometry of a possession. Some involve coming to the ball, some involve spacing the floor, and some involve crashing to the rim. These interact with each other in varying ways, so it is important to think about them separately.
												<ul style="margin: 0;">
													<li>One important pattern: there are diminishing returns to having more players come to the ball or crash the rim (PNRs usually have one screener, sometimes two, never four). However there are increasing returns to having more players space the floor (e.g., the 2024 Celtics who won a title almost exclusively playing lineups with 5 good floor spacers)</li>
												</ul></li>
											<li><u>Opportunities are dependent</u>: Players attacking off-ball need to get the ball before they can capitalize. When are they more likely to get the ball? When their teammates think they are open. This means shots that are attempted are disproportionately likely to be open. If the shot isn't open, the off-ball player will likely just move the ball along without shooting, or never receive it in the first place. We need to account for this selection effect when looking at the efficiency of these shots.</li>
										</ul>
									
										<p>What does this mean for our stats?: </p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Actions included:</b> Off-ball actions (as defined by synergy play types) are subdivided into 3 sub categories based on court geometry
												<ul style="margin: 0;">
													<li><u>Partner</u>: Directly playing off the on-ball player by receving handoffs or rolling or popping out of a PNR screen</li>
													<li><u>Space</u>: Spotting up, running off a screen as a shooter</li>
													<li><u>Crash</u>: Cutting to the rim, playing out of the dunker's spot, attempting putbacks </li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li><b>Possessions counted:</b> Off-ball plays include all times where the player ended a possession with an off-ball scoring attempt or turnover. Due to data limitations, playmaking attempts are not included. Similarly to on-ball, we look at this per game (plays/g) or per 75 possessions (plays/75)</li>
											<li><b>Efficiency baseline:</b> League-average offensive rating for that play type or league average half court offensive rating, whichever is higher. Comparing to average efficiency for that play type allows us to account for the fact that some off-ball attempts are naturally efficient almost regardless of who takes them</li>
										</ul>

									<!-- Transition-->
										<hr class="major" />
										<h2 id="Transition">Transition</h2>

										<p>The above on-ball and off-ball stats are both concerned about the half court when teams are playing 5-on-5. But the early seconds of a possession before both teams are back and set are an important source of offense. </p>
									
										<p>To analyze transition, we need to keep a few things in mind:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Scoring and playmaking blend</u>: Even more than in the half-court, the line between scoring and playmaking in transition is blurred. Great transition players put defenders in a bind. They use their scoring threat to force the defender to commit and open up a teammate for an easy shot, and at the same time they use the threat of that pass to open up attack lanes for themselves.</li>
											<li><u>Mediocre transition efficiency is great offense</u>: In 2024, the least efficient transition offense (Denver) averaged 119.6 points per 100 in transition. The same season, the most efficient half court offense (Boston) averaged 106.5 points per 100, 13 points worse. Players that can generate more transition possessions and keep their team out of the half court have a major impact on their team's offensive success.</li>
										</ul>
									
										<p>To capture these dynamics, BUCKETS defines a few stats for transition plays:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Actions included:</b> We use Synergy's definition of transition plays, with the addition of potential assists and potential FT assists not captured by Synergy tracking</li>
											<li><b>Possessions counted:</b> All possessions that end with a transition scoring attempt, playmaking attempt, or turnover. This includes field goal attempts, free throw attempts, and turnovers by the player themself or by a teammate they had just passed to. Similarly to on-ball, we look at this per game (plays/g) or per 75 possessions (plays/75)</li>
											<li><b>Efficiency baseline:</b> League-average half court offensive rating. This recognizes the value created by players who push the ball and create transition opportunities, rather than walking it up and settling for a half court possession. As a result, almost all players in the league have a positive transition rORTG.</li>
										</ul>
				
									<!--Limitations-->	
										<hr class="major" />
										<h2>Limitations</h2>
		
										<p>We believe that the stats introduced here are the best numbers to look at first to understand how a player performs on-ball, off-ball, and in transition. However, they have some limitations:</p>
									
										<p>In particular, these stats do not measure:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Anything before the 2005-06 season, when Synergy started tracking possession data for every team in the league</li>
												<li>The impact of the opposing defense. These stats are not currently adjusted based on the quality of the opposing defenses a player faces </li>
												<li>The impact of team roster and context.</li>
												<li>Anything outside of actions that end a possession with a shot, pass, or turnover. This means these stats don't see…
													<ul style="margin: 0;">
														<li>“Record scratches” that fizzle out an action and allow no the defense to reset</li>
														<li>Non scoring/playmaking impact from things like setting screens, boxing out, or calling out plays.</li>
														<li>How the player indirectly warps the defense through gravity or hockey assists
															<ul style="margin: 0;">
																<li>However, many indirect effects are at least correlated with the direct effects measured by these stats. For example, players with higher off-ball spacing volume and efficiency will also tend to have the biggest gravity, as opposing defense respond to that scoring  threat. And similarly the same players who have the biggest on-ball volume and efficiency in these stats will also tend to be the biggest generators of hockey assists.
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
													</ul></li>
