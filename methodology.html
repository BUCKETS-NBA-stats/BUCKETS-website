									<!--Intro-->
									<p>BUCKETS<sup><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="BUCKETS stands for Baseline adjUsted Categorized KrEation poinTS. We couldn't resist the sabermetric tradition of giving dubious acronyms to new advanced stats.">[1]</span></sup>
										 is a new set of NBA stats that accounts for every point created, every possession used to create them, and the context in which those things happen. It consists of:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>PRF (Points Responsible For):</b> Points scored + assisted, including both field goals and free throws. This measures offensive <b>production</b></li>
										<li><b>Plays:</b> Total possessions the player used while attempting to score or set up a teammate, including field goal attempts, free throw attempts, and turnovers. This measures offensive <b>volume</b> or usage</li>
										<li><b>PRF baseline:</b> (Total plays) x (baseline points per possession for that play type). This establishes a context-specific threshold to measure efficiency against</li>
										<li><b>rORTG (relative offensive rating)</b> (PRF - PRF baseline)/Plays. This measures offensive <b>efficiency</b></li>
										<li><b>PC (Points Created):</b> Plays x rORTG (or equivalently, PRF - PRF baseline). This measures total offensive <b>value</b> added over the baseline</li>
									</ul>
									<p>These stats are available as far back as the 2005-06 season.</p>
									<p>The rest of this article explains <a href="#Motivation">why we need new stats</a>, <a href="#Uses">what they are useful for</a>, <a href ="#Methodology">how they are calculated</a>, and <a href="#Limitations">what the limitations are</a>.</p>

									<!--Why new stats-->
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2 id="Motivation">Why we need new stats</h2>

									<p>Together, the BUCKETS stats do several useful things that traditional box scores and existing advanced stats don't:</p>

									<h4>Count every point created</h4>
									<p>Scoring and playmaking are two sides of the same coin. The best offensive players use the threat of their scoring to set up opportunities for their teammates, and use the threat of their playmaking to open up scoring chances for themselves.</p>
									<p>Existing stats like points per game, assists, and true shooting only look at one side of this coin or the other. But points scored and points created for teammates both count the same on the scoreboard. BUCKETS considers them all together.</p>
									
									<h4>Count every possession used</h4>
									<p>In the process of trying to score or create for teammates, players might attempt a field goal, generate a free throw, or turn the ball over, or pass to a teammate who immediately does any of those things.</p>
									<p>Almost all usage and efficiency stats (like usage % and true shooting) only account for some of these events<sup><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Seth Partnow's Total Usage is an exception">[2]</span></sup>. But all of these events are ways that possessions are used in the pursuit of creating points. BUCKETS counts them all.</p>

									<h4>Account for context and role</h4>
									<p>All points count equally, but not all points are created equally. Someone needs to face down a set defense and try to create an advantage with the ball. Other players support this by spacing the floor, setting screens, fighting for position, and moving off-ball. To understand how valuable a player's offense is, we need to understand the role he is playing.</p>
									<p>Existing stats have no way to account for this - they can't distinguish a player creating points against a set half court defense from a player finishing easy shots created by others. BUCKETS understands and accounts for this context.</p>

									<!--What they are useful for-->
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2 id="Uses">What these stats are useful for</h2>

									<p>Here are some examples of what you can do with these stats:</p>
									
									<h4>Understand players' roles and effectiveness</h4>
									<p>Our stats provide a useful snapshot into a player's game, the roles he plays, and how effective he is in those roles. For example, on <a href="player career.html?player=Aaron Gordon">Aaron Gordon's player profile</a>, you can see his evolution from an inefficient on-ball creator and shooter in his Orlando years to an efficient third option and dunker's spot threat in Denver. You can explore more players on our <a href="player career.html">player career</a> and <a href="player season.html">player season</a> pages.</p>

									<h4>Analyze how team offenses fit together</h4>
									<p>Looking across all the players on a team provides a picture of who fills what roles on offense, and how well the pieces synergize or don't. For example, on the <a href="team summary.html?team=Houston Rockets 2016-17">2016-17 Houston Rockets team page</a>, you can see how much they were built around James Harden. He shouldered the lions share of on-ball possessions, with MVP level effectiveness. He was flanked by dependent players. Some were plus floor spacers who could create a bit off of Harden's gravity (like Eric Gordon, Lou Williams, and Patrick Beverly). Others were Hardens rollers and lob threats (like Clint Capela). You can explore more yourself on our <a href="team summary.html"><a>teams page</a>.</p>

									<h4>Contextualize where players stand relative to the league</h4>
									<p>Our <a href="league table.html">League leaderboards</a> show that Steve Nash had 3 of the 4 most valuable on-ball seasons on record, while Lebron James is probably the greatest transition player of all time. You can dive further into the details with our <a href="custom league table.html">Custom table builder</a> and <a href="bubble chart.html">Custom chart builder</a></p>
									
									<h4>Get perspectives on player valuations and all-time rankings</h4>
									<p>These stats aren't the end-all, be-all of evaluating offense. But if you look at the <a href="all time peaks.html">players with the highest regular season peaks in points created</a>, you'll see a who's who of the best offensive players of the last two decades: Lebron, Curry, Nash, CP3, Durant, Harden, and Jokic.</p>

									<h4>Create a foundation for deeper research</h4>
									<p>For example, these stats give the clearest picture available of a player's value as an on-ball creator. We can use that to <a href="floor raising.html">quantify the value of "floor-raising"</a>.</p>

									<!-- Detailed Methodology -->
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2 id="Methodology">How BUCKETS stats are calculated</h2>
										
									<p>BUCKETS is based on the concept that <strong>Roles matter</strong>. To evaluate a player on offense, we need to understand what roles they are playing, what it means to be successful in each of those roles, and how effective they are relative to that standards</p>
									<p>This table summarizes how we define and measure each of these roles. A more detailed explanation follows below the table.</p>

									<!--On ball-->
										<h3 id="On-ball">On-ball</h3>
										<p>This role is about breaking down a set defense to create an advantage. In the modern NBA, this is most commonly done as a pick and roll ball handler, but it can also be done through isolations, post ups, and running offense from the elbows. When we talk about whether a player is a “superstar” or "#1 option", we usually mean their skill in this role.</p>
										<p>To analyze on-ball creation, we need to keep a few things in mind:</p>
									
										<ul>
											<li><u>Scoring and playmaking blend</u>: Great offensive players use the threat of their scoring to open up the pass and the threat of their passing to open up their scoring. To understand their effectiveness, you have to look at both of those pieces together.</li>
											<li><u>Someone has to do it</u>: A possession where no one creates an advantage usually results in a turnover, contested heave, or shot clock violation. To avoid those bad outcomes, someone needs to create an advantage. Many players can do this against a scrambled defense, but few can do it play after play when the opponent is expecting them. Being able to absorb that creation at high volume is hugely valuable.</li>
											<li><u>Only one ball</u>: When one player is actively creating with the ball in their hands, that has an opportunity cost: their teammates can't be creating with the ball at the same time. On good teams with multiple skilled on-ball creators, this create diminishing returns. There are ways to mitigate this with careful schemes and rotations, but generally these teams will have a hard time using all of their on-ball creators to their full potential.</li>
										</ul>
									
										<p>What does this mean for our stats?</p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Actions included:</b> Plays categorized by Synergy as Pick and roll ball handler possessions, Isolations, Post-Ups, and a handful of "Miscellaneous" plays. We also include “Connective Passing” plays not categorized by Synergy. These are other half court playmaking opportunities, primarily hitting teammates off screens, handoffs, and cuts.</li>
											<li><b>Possessions counted:</b> All possessions that end with an on-ball scoring attempt, playmaking attempt, or turnover. This includes field goal attempts, free throw attempts, and turnovers by the player themself, and also FGAs, FTs, and TOs by a teammate they had just passed to. For "connective passing", we estimate potential assists, potential free throw assists, and turnovers based on league average half court free throw rates, estimated FG% on connective passing assists, and rates of "miscellaneous" and "bad pass" turnovers.
											<li><b>Efficiency baseline:</b> League-average half court offensive rating. This provides a team-agnostic definition of the "opportunity cost" of only one player being able to create on-ball at a time. The true opportunity cost will vary depending on the quality of the player's teammates. For more on this, see <a href="floor raising.html">our article on what we call the Westbrook Theorem</a> </li>
										</ul>
									
									<!--Off ball-->
										<h3 id="Off-ball">Off-ball</h3>
			
										<p>This role is about all the ways a player can generate points in the half court without being the one running the play. It includes spotting up, running off screens, rolling or popping after a pick, receiving handoffs, cutting, and trying for putbacks. While one player is creating on-ball, the other 4 players are doing some combination of these. When we talk about a player being a good "role player" on offense, we usually are referring to their skills in these roles.</p>
									
										<p>To analyze off-ball roles, we need to keep a few things in mind:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Court geometry matters</u>: Different off-ball actions function differently in the geometry of a possession. Some involve coming to the ball, some involve spacing the floor, and some involve crashing to the rim. These interact with each other in varying ways, so it is important to think about them separately.
											<li><u>Opportunities are dependent</u>: Players attacking off-ball need to get the ball before they can capitalize. When are they more likely to get the ball? When their teammates think they are open. This means off-ball shots that are attempted are disproportionately likely to be open. If the shot isn't open, the off-ball player will likely just move the ball along without shooting, or never receive it in the first place. We need to account for this selection effect when looking at the efficiency of these shots.</li>
										</ul>
									
										<p>What does this mean for our stats?: </p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Actions included:</b> Off-ball actions (as defined by synergy play types) are subdivided into 3 sub categories based on court geometry
												<ul style="margin: 0;">
													<li><u>Partner</u>: Directly playing off the on-ball player by receving handoffs or rolling or popping out of a PNR screen</li>
													<li><u>Space</u>: Spotting up, running off a screen as a shooter</li>
													<li><u>Crash</u>: Cutting to the rim, playing out of the dunker's spot, attempting putbacks </li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li><b>Possessions counted:</b> Off-ball plays include all times where the player ended a possession with an off-ball scoring attempt or turnover. Due to data limitations, playmaking attempts are not included.</li>
											<li><b>Efficiency baseline:</b> League-average offensive rating for that play type <u>or</u> league average half court offensive rating, whichever is higher. Comparing to average efficiency for that play type allows us to account for the fact that some off-ball attempts are naturally efficient almost regardless of who takes them. For example, by the time a player has gotten the ball on a cut to the rim and is attempting a shot, we expect them to score most of the time. </li>
										</ul>

									<!-- Transition-->
										<h3 id="Transition">Transition</h3>

										<p>The above on-ball and off-ball stats are both concerned about the half court when teams are playing 5-on-5. But the early seconds of a possession before both teams are back and set are an important source of offense. </p>
									
										<p>To analyze transition, we need to keep a few things in mind:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Scoring and playmaking blend</u>: Even more than in the half-court, the line between scoring and playmaking in transition is blurred. Great transition players put defenders in a bind. They use their scoring threat to force the defender to commit and open up a teammate for an easy shot, and at the same time they use the threat of that pass to open up attack lanes for themselves.</li>
											<li><u>Mediocre transition efficiency is great offense</u>: In 2024, the least efficient transition offense (Denver) averaged 119.6 points per 100 in transition. The same season, the most efficient half court offense (Boston) averaged 106.5 points per 100. In other words, the "worst" transition offense was still 13 points per 100 better than the best half court offense. Players that can generate more transition possessions and keep their team out of the half court have a major impact on their team's offensive success.</li>
										</ul>
									
										<p>What does this mean for our stats?</p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Actions included:</b> We use Synergy's definition of transition plays, with the addition of estimated potential assists and potential FT assists not captured by Synergy tracking</li>
											<li><b>Possessions counted:</b> All possessions that end with a transition scoring attempt, playmaking attempt, or turnover. This includes field goal attempts, free throw attempts, and turnovers by the player themself or by a teammate they had just passed to. We estimate potential assists and potential free throw assists based on league average free-throw rates in transition and an estimated field goal % on transition potential assists.</li>
											<li><b>Efficiency baseline:</b> League-average <u>half court</u> offensive rating. This recognizes the value created by players who push the ball and create transition opportunities, rather than walking it up and settling for a half court possession. As a result, almost all players in the league have a positive transition rORTG.</li>
										</ul>
				
									<!--Limitations-->	
										<hr class="major" />
										<h2 id="Limitations">Limitations</h2>
		
										<p>We believe that the stats introduced here are the best numbers to look at first to understand how a player performs on offense. However, they are not perfect.</p>
									
										<p>Most boringly, our stats don't know about anything before 2005-06. We rely on tracking data, which only became reliable and widespread in the 2005-06 season. BUCKETS can't be calculated before then (unless some hero were to take on the project to retroactively tracks thousands of games).</p>
										<p>Our stats also don't account for team and opponent context. We don't adjust for the quality of the opposing defense a player faces, nor do we adjust for a team's own roster, rotations, and scheme. We are only reporting the actual stats as they happened.</p>
										<p>Our stats also don't see anything outside of actions that end with a possession with a scoring attempt, playmaking attempt, or turnover. For example our stats don't measure the ways that players indirectly warp the defense through gravity and hockey assists. That said, we believe that these indirect impacts are correlated with the direct impact that we do measure. The players who rank highest in our Off-ball Spacing metrics will have the most gravity, and the best on-ball creators will also generate the most hockey assists.</p>
										<p>However, there are other elements of offense that our stats don't measure, even indirectly. For example, our stats can't see "record scratches" that fizzle out an action and allow the defense to reset. They also don't measure non scoring/playmaking impact from things like setting screens, boxing out, or calling out plays.</p>
